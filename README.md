Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Blackjack Game Variant

## Team Member(s): 

**Nan Yang, Wei Zhong**

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

- **Purpose**: use monte carlo to test whether the blackjack variant is profitable for casinos, according to real life blackjack strategy

- **Base Model**: single deck, single player, original blackjack rules

- **Updated Model**: add new rules to the original game, such
as changing pay rate under the same color, and having choice of bet under double down


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty

- **Simulation Variable**: pay rate under same color situation; the bet under double down situation

- **Distribution of Variable**: both variables follow uniform distribution [a, b]

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

- The variant version will bring more profit for casinos


## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
